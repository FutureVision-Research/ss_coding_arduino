/* May 2024 Challenge - without bonus challenge
  Write a sketch and build a circuit that lights up four LEDs from four different digital pins.
  LED 1 should be red. It should light up for one second, then turn off.
  LED 2 should be green. It should light up and wait for 5 seconds before going on to the next step.
  LED 3 should be red. It should light up for 7 seconds and then turn off.
  LED 4 should be green. It should light up for 9 seconds.
  Then turn all LEDs off for 30 seconds and then restart.
  Notes: Use whichever GPIO pins you want to use. Donâ€™t forget your resistors!
